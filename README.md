CD_to_GMT_to_UMAP
=================================================
## Compute signatures using two methods and benchmark them
1. Signatures with perturbations of morphine (Water/DMSO only pert not included) vs. all other samples in the same batch
2. Signatures with perturbations of morphine (Water/DMSO only pert not included) vs. DMSO/Water only samples same batch

## GMT files Generate
1. Compute signatures with th two methods above using Characteristic Direction
2. Generate GMT file for every signatures and CD's up and down genes results

## Benchmarking
1. UMAP visualization
2. Bridge Plots of Morphine Target Genes from Enrichr with GMT files produce above
